> üê≥ docker as the image container to get and load the image from the internet or local, then save them into the docker in the docker. 
> üòÜ for me, it is the database for image :P 

üíª My laptop is: üçé Mac air -- OS X EL Capitan -- Version 10.11.4

[link](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=whalesay&starCount=0)

![Find this row and select it](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-296a615e82a99e4f.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

From this page, you can find the way to help you load the image from the docker, there are thousands of images on the docker include some large company such as IBM, Google and other else. As you enter the web page, for example the whalesay, you can see the "how to use this image" for helping using the image in the terminal 

so... 
here is the code you need to enter to get the whalesay image (i am really confused what the expression the whale will say, let us take a look by enter the below code first üòÉ )

$ means the start on the terminal, you don't need to enter it within the terminal, if you see in the other place. In here, i prefer delete it and give you the code you need to enter in the code mode. 

    docker run docker/whalesay cowsay boo


![whale say !! ](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-3c120faf7e006364.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Here is what the terminal display after the "docker run docker/whalesay cowsay boo" 

oh, actually, you can see the boo on the left top which is different from the whale before...

..... it says:"boo"!!

Now, we try to see what kinds of images we have so far in our own containers: 

    docker images


![docker images](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-ee9576191cfdcd78.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

There is two packages of images in the docker in your local, after we making sure that the üê≥ "whalesay" package 

    docker run docker/whalesay cowsay boo-boo


![boo](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-91907999e7059b26.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

üê≥ whale now is your guest and say boo to you 


----

### Step1: write a docker file 

- open the whale terminal and let us start üòÑ

      mkdir mydockerbuild

mkdir (make directory): create a new directory 

    cd mydockerbuild

- open the new created directory, cd means open in the terminal as you seen before (cheatsheet is on the bottom of the page )

    
    touch Dockerfile

create a Dockerfile in the directory 

    ls Dockerfile

read the Dockerfile 

     open -e Dockerfile
There is another window coming out, here is the text file you can enter the text 

![text file window](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-aff0ef02b04d4283.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Type the text below in the text file : 

      FROM docker/whalesay:latest

- FROM: the keyword to tell where does the image coming from and execute the action the image after  from 

![enter the text](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-10efb547e2f0ef9c.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

    RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y fortunes

    CMD /user/games/fortune -a | cowsay


![whole text](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-b423e5e0cc1f27d9.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

then use the File>save or command -S to save the file 


![run in terminal](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-c8274ef47f13713f.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

As you run in the terminal, you can see the text was shown. 



### Step 2: Build an image from your Dockerfile 

    cat Dockerfile

cat: it is not the cat üê± , but the action of "CATCH" miao~~
    
    docker build -t docker-whale .


![successful built ](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/149762-0e4449cf88e9fea3.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
